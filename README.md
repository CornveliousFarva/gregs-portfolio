# gregs-portfolio

Overview: a responsive portfolio, with links to About, Portfolio projects, and a place to contact. Any constructive criticism on this page is greatly appreciated.

1/4/20: moved the placeholder images from the main page to the portfolio and cleaned up the image placement. I also made the navbar easy to navigate, with minimal media queries.

# purpose
This is my portfolio of assignments I worked on in class and some things I have done after class ended to showcase my accomplishments as a developer. After trying to figure out how to do it on React, I realized it would be simpler to use a version using just HTML and CSS and add projects with more advanced technology to it, thus making future deployments easier.
